Smithsonian exhibition instructions 
===================================

- create a sub-site named 'fieldbooks' using the instructions here: http://support.discoverygarden.ca/projects/si/wiki/Subsite_Setup
I started off with a fresh drupal install for my sub-site. A fresh drupal install would work fine as there is not too much to configure

Download and place in /sites/ip-addresss.fieldbook/modules/ :
- si_exhibition: https://github.com/discoverygarden/si_exhibition
- shadowbox: http://drupal.org/project/shadowbox

Download and place in /sites/all/libraries/
- FlexPaper: Download the latest flash version:  http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/download/ 

Update Sidora in /sites/all/modules/sidora with the latest 'Exhibition' branch located at https://github.com/DannyJoris/sidora/tree/exhibition
This might need a merge as some commits aren't included yet: https://github.com/DannyJoris/sidora/network

Pull the latest changes for the Smithsonian theme.

Enable following modules:
- all required islandora modules
- sidora_settings (don't enable sidora)
- si_exhibition (Smithsonian Exhibition Piece)
- shadowbox
- skinr



Configuration (from fresh drupal install)

- make sure the user (anonymous) has the right permissions to view the collection.

- enable the Smithsonian theme at admin/build/themes/select and configure at admin/build/themes/settings/smithsonian

Configure the si_exhibition module at admin/settings/si_exhibition:
- select 'combined'
This will expose the object navigation as a block.

Go to the block settings at admin/build/block/list/smithsonian
- Place the 'SI Navigation' block in the 'sidebar last' region.
- Save and edit block settings.
- You can optionally rename the title from 'SI Navigation' to 'Navigation'.
- under 'Smithsonian styles' check 'white background'
- no need to set page specific display settings. The block will only show up on an islandora object view.

Make sure any other blocks in sidebar first or sidebar last won't show up on the object views by editing their display settings like this:
[x] Show on every page except the listed pages.

Extra:
======
In case the objects on the production server don't have any data attached to the resource objects there might be a need to add sample data:

OBJ         = pdf (( application/pdf ))
OBJ.swf  = .swf generated from .pdf  (( application/x-shockwave-flash ))
IMAGE    = image jpeg (( image/jpeg ))
TEXT       = .txt file  (( text/plain ))
CSV         = .csv file  (( text/csv ))
VIDEO     = not configured yet.
